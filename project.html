        <p class="txtcol"> Introducing Harmony Hunt, a platform dedicated to support emerging artists with 1,000 to 500,000 streams, addressing the challenge they face in gaining visibility on streaming services at the early stages of their careers. </p>
        <p class="txtcol">Developed and deployed Harmony Hunt on Google Play Store using React Native Expo and Jamendo API, achieving over 10+ downloads! </p>
        <p class="txtcol">It is not just a music streaming service but also a talent hunting platform where you can get to discover artists who are either new to the music industry, missed out on mainstream recognition or just trying to pursue music as a hobby!</p>

                <p class="txtcol">The rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has led to many software applications integrating AI services into their platforms. For example, companies such as Snapchat have implemented AI chatbots that engage with users and respond to their questions / commands through text. </p>
                <p class="txtcol">However, this project uses a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with human-computer interaction through natural language. By utilising Python libraries like Speech recognition, gtts, and pygame, it generates initial and OpenAI API-derived responses.</p>
                <p class="txtcol">In simple terms, users can speak with the chatbot, which generates responses in return.</p>

            <p class="txtcol">Every year Computer Science Department of Edge Hill University creates Student Timetables used within students of all departments of the University as well as staff. However, students often face challenges understanding the timetable in first few weeks of University.   </p>
            <p class="txtcol">Therefore, I conducted a UX research study on timetables and problems were identified by researching past problems happening with University timetabling and personalisation.  </p>
            <p class="txtcol">Based on the problems identified via literature research and UX research methods (Persona, questionnaires and user interviews),  I created an improved version of timetable which brings clarity within instructions and would help students understand contents of the timetable better.</p>
            <p class="txtcol">To use this timetable, visit the website and enter the credentials provided in the GitHub repository's public directory <a href="https://github.com/Shantanugupta43/Student-Timetable-React-App/blob/main/public/studentlist.csv">studentlist.csv</a>.
