                <p class="txtcol">The rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has led to many software applications integrating AI services into their platforms. For example, companies such as Snapchat have implemented AI chatbots that engage with users and respond to their questions / commands through text. </p>
                <p class="txtcol">However, this project uses a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with human-computer interaction through natural language. By utilising Python libraries like Speech recognition, gtts, and pygame, it generates initial and OpenAI API-derived responses.</p>
                <p class="txtcol">In simple terms, users can speak with the chatbot, which generates responses in return.</p>

            <p class="txtcol">Every year Computer Science Department of Edge Hill University creates Student Timetables used within students of all departments of the University as well as staff. However, students often face challenges understanding the timetable in first few weeks of University.   </p>
            <p class="txtcol">Therefore, I conducted a UX research study on timetables and problems were identified by researching past problems happening with University timetabling and personalisation.  </p>
            <p class="txtcol">Based on the problems identified via literature research and UX research methods (Persona, questionnaires and user interviews),  I created an improved version of timetable which brings clarity within instructions and would help students understand contents of the timetable better.</p>
            <p class="txtcol">To use this timetable, visit the website and enter the credentials provided in the GitHub repository's public directory <a href="https://github.com/Shantanugupta43/Student-Timetable-React-App/blob/main/public/studentlist.csv">studentlist.csv</a>. Note: The usernames and passwords provided in CSV files are used for testing on this specific project only. The credentials are not affiliated with Edge Hill's actual website.</p>

            <p class="txtcol">One of my first React Projects on a brief provided by AdTrack. This test website is about tree surgery which offers services such as pollarding, stump grinding, deadwooding etc. </p>
            <p class="txtcol">The projects are based on real world live sites. However, requirements provided by adtrak have been modified to not interfere with SEO, performance of each site in this practice scenario case. </p>
            <p class="txtcol">Requirements such as good header/footer, call to action, hero banner have been implemented through design thinking. In this process, wireframes and designs were planned using Figma and a web build was created based on the designs.</p>
